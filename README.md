README for the CodeFire Framework
=================================

Developed by SpaceEmotion.

This software uses the CodeIgniter framework as a base.
You can find its official github repository here: https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/

To not reinvent the wheel this framework uses the following libraries (Please note: They have been modified to make it work all together!):

 - ag_auth by Adam Griffiths (https://github.com/adamgriffiths/ag-auth/)
 - Template system by Jens Segers (https://github.com/segersjens/CodeIgniter-Template-Library)
 - PHPass by Jens Segers (https://github.com/jenssegers/CodeIgniter-Phpass-Library)
